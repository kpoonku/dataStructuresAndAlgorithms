/*
You are given an array of variable pairs equations and an array of real numbers values,
where equations[i] = [Ai, Bi] and values[i] represent the equation Ai / Bi = values[i].
Each Ai or Bi is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some queries, where queries[j] = [Cj, Dj] represents the jth query where you
must find the answer for Cj / Dj = ?.

Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return -1.0.

Note: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result
in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.

Note: The variables that do not occur in the list of equations are undefined,
so the answer cannot be determined for them.

Example 1:
Input:
equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]],
values = [2.0,3.0],
queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]

Explanation:
Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ?
return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
note: x is undefined => -1.0

Example 2:
Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]],
values = [1.5,2.5,5.0],
queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]

Example 3:
Input: equations = [["a","b"]],
values = [0.5],
queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]

Constraints:
1 <= equations.length <= 20
equations[i].length == 2
1 <= Ai.length, Bi.length <= 5
values.length == equations.length
0.0 < values[i] <= 20.0
1 <= queries.length <= 20
queries[i].length == 2
1 <= Cj.length, Dj.length <= 5
Ai, Bi, Cj, Dj consist of lower case English letters and digits.

Absolutely! Let's break this logic down **step by step** using a **real-world analogy**
so it makes sense for any human brain üòä

---

### üí° THE PROBLEM ‚Äî In Plain English

You are given a set of relationships like:

> "a divided by b equals 2"
> "b divided by c equals 3"

And someone asks you questions like:

> "What is a divided by c?"
> "What is b divided by a?"
> "What is a divided by e?" (You don‚Äôt even know what 'e' is)

---

### ‚úÖ What Are We Doing?

We are solving **math puzzles** where some equations are known and you want to
**connect the dots** to find the answer to others.

---

### üß† HUMAN EXAMPLE

Say you know:

- 1 apple = 2 bananas ‚Üí `a / b = 2`
- 1 banana = 3 cherries ‚Üí `b / c = 3`

Now you want to figure out:

- How many cherries in 1 apple?

Let's work it out step by step:

```
1 apple = 2 bananas
1 banana = 3 cherries
So, 1 apple = 2 * 3 = 6 cherries
‚Üí a / c = 6
```

We "linked" a ‚Üí b ‚Üí c and **multiplied** along the way.

---

### ü§ñ Now Let's Translate That into a Program

We'll use a **graph**. Think of this like a map where each **variable**
(a, b, c) is a city, and each equation is a **road** with a **weight**.

#### Equations:
```
a / b = 2.0  ‚Üí a ‚Äî(2.0)‚Üí b
              b ‚Äî(0.5)‚Üí a   (reverse direction)

b / c = 3.0  ‚Üí b ‚Äî(3.0)‚Üí c
              c ‚Äî(1/3.0)‚Üí b
```

We build this map (graph) with **both directions**,
because you might need to go from `c ‚Üí a` or `a ‚Üí c`.

---

### üß≠ Answering a Query (a / c)

To figure this out:
- Start from `a`
- Try to find a path to `c`
- Multiply the weights as you go:
  - `a ‚Üí b = 2`
  - `b ‚Üí c = 3`
  - So: `a / c = 2 * 3 = 6`

---

### üö∂ Walkthrough in Human Steps

1. **Build the graph** from the equations. Each node connects to its neighbor with a value.
2. For each **query**, do a **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Start from the **first variable**
   - Walk through the graph, multiplying the values as you go
   - If you reach the **target variable**, return the result
   - If you can't reach it ‚Üí return `-1`

---

### üí¨ Real-Life Analogy: Currency Exchange

If:
- $1 USD = 0.85 EUR
- ‚Ç¨1 EUR = 130 JPY

Then how many JPY is $1?

Easy:
- USD ‚Üí EUR ‚Üí JPY
- 1 * 0.85 * 130 = 110.5 JPY

We just multiplied along the path!

### üõ†Ô∏è So the Code Is Just Doing This:
- Build the graph of relationships
- For each question, walk the graph and multiply
- If a path doesn‚Äôt exist ‚Üí return -1.0
