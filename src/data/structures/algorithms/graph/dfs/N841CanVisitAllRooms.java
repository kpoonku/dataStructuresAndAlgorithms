841. Keys and Rooms
There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all
the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it
unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you
can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Explanation:
We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.
We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.
We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.
We then visit room 3.
Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.

Example 2:
Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
Explanation: We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.

Constraints:
n == rooms.length
2 <= n <= 1000
0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000
1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000
0 <= rooms[i][j] < n
All the values of rooms[i] are unique.

Let's break this problem down in **very simple, beginner-level** terms ‚Äî like a puzzle or adventure game.
---
## üóùÔ∏è The Story (Beginner-Friendly)
Imagine you're in a hallway with many **locked rooms**, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.
* **Only room 0 is unlocked** at the start.
* When you go into a room, you might **find keys** to other rooms.
* Your goal is to use those keys to **unlock and enter all rooms**.
You‚Äôre given a list of rooms. Each room contains a **list of keys**.
You need to check:
> Is it possible to **visit all the rooms** using the keys you find along the way?
---
## üß™ Example 1:
```
rooms = [[1], [2], [3], []]
```
Let‚Äôs walk through it:
* Start at room `0`, find key to room `1`
* Go to room `1`, find key to room `2`
* Go to room `2`, find key to room `3`
* Go to room `3`, done!
‚úÖ All rooms visited ‚Äî return `true`
---
## ‚ùå Example 2:
```
rooms = [[1,3], [3,0,1], [2], [0]]
```
* Start at room `0`, find keys to rooms `1` and `3`
* Go to room `1`, find more keys but not for room `2`
* Go to room `3`, no key to room `2`
* Room `2` is still locked, and we don‚Äôt have its key!
‚ùå Cannot visit all rooms ‚Äî return `false`
---
## üß† How to Think About It
Think of this like:
* You're exploring a **maze of rooms**
* You collect keys from each room
* You use the keys to unlock **new rooms**
* Keep track of which rooms you‚Äôve already visited
* Stop when either:
  * You've visited **all rooms** ‚úÖ
  * Or you run out of keys and **some rooms are still locked** ‚ùå
---
## üîç Real-World Analogy
It‚Äôs like a **treasure hunt**:
* You start with one open door
* Inside, you find clues (keys) to more doors
* Your goal is to open **every door** using the clues you collect
---
## üß† Core Concepts Behind the Problem
This is actually a **graph traversal problem** in computer science:
* Rooms are **nodes**
* Keys represent **edges**
* You're trying to **visit all nodes** in a connected graph
You can solve it using:
* **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
* or **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
