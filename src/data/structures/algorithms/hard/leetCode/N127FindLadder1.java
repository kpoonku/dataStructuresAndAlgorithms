/*
A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return all the shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words [beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk].



Example 1:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]
Explanation: There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
"hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
"hit" -> "hot" -> "lot" -> "log" -> "cog"
Example 2:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: []
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.


Constraints:

1 <= beginWord.length <= 5
endWord.length == beginWord.length
1 <= wordList.length <= 500
wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
beginWord != endWord
All the words in wordList are unique.
The sum of all shortest transformation sequences does not exceed 105.

This `bfs` method is part of a **Word Ladder II** solution in Java. It's used to build a **graph of word transformations** and record the **shortest path levels** from the `beginWord` to every reachable word in the `wordSet`.

---

### ‚úÖ Method Signature:

```java
private void bfs(String beginWord, String endWord,
                 Set<String> wordSet, Map<String, List<String>> graph,
                 Map<String, Integer> level)
```

| Parameter   | Purpose                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `beginWord` | Starting word of the transformation.                                |
| `endWord`   | Target word to reach.                                               |
| `wordSet`   | Set of valid words for transformation.                              |
| `graph`     | Maps each word to its **neighbors** (words one letter away).        |
| `level`     | Maps each word to the **minimum number of steps** from `beginWord`. |

---

### üîÑ High-Level Flow:

1. Use **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to explore all possible word transformations from `beginWord`.
2. **Build the graph** of valid transformations: each word connects to its one-letter-different neighbors.
3. **Track the shortest level** (number of transformations) for each word using the `level` map.
4. Stop early if `endWord` is found.

---

### üß† Line-by-Line Explanation:

```java
Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
queue.offer(beginWord);
level.put(beginWord, 0);
```

* Start BFS from `beginWord`.
* Initialize the level (distance) of `beginWord` to `0`.

---

```java
while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
    int size = queue.size();
    boolean foundEnd = false;
```

* Process each level of BFS.
* `foundEnd` is used to **stop early** if `endWord` is found at the current level.

---

```java
for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    String word = queue.poll();
    List<String> neighbors = getNeighbors(word, wordSet);
```

* For each word at the current level, get all possible **one-letter neighbors** using `getNeighbors()`.

---

```java
    for (String neighbor : neighbors) {
        graph.computeIfAbsent(word, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(neighbor);
```

* Add a directed edge from `word` to its neighbor in the `graph`.

---

```java
        if (!level.containsKey(neighbor)) {
            level.put(neighbor, level.get(word) + 1);
```

* If the neighbor hasn't been visited yet (i.e., doesn't exist in `level`), assign it a level one more than `word`.

---

```java
            if (neighbor.equals(endWord)) {
                foundEnd = true;
            } else {
                queue.offer(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
```

* If this neighbor is the `endWord`, set `foundEnd` to stop the BFS early.
* Otherwise, enqueue it to be processed in the next BFS layer.

---

```java
if (foundEnd) break;
```

* Exit BFS early after discovering `endWord` at the current level (to ensure **only shortest paths** are considered).

---

### ‚úÖ Purpose of `bfs`:

* Build a **graph of valid word transformations**.
* Record the **shortest distance** from `beginWord` to every reachable word using the `level` map.
* Supports a later **DFS or backtracking phase** to reconstruct all the shortest transformation sequences.

Here's a **simplified Java version** of the `findLadders` method that returns all the shortest transformation sequences using BFS and backtracking. This version keeps things straightforward and readable, suitable for interviews or understanding the core idea.
