Given strings s1, s2, and s3, find whether s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.

An interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where s and t are divided into n and m substrings respectively, such that:

s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn
t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm
|n - m| <= 1
The interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...
Note: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.

ChatGPT said:
The problem of checking whether a string s3 is formed by an interleaving of two strings s1 and s2 can be solved using dynamic programming (DP). Let's break down the logic step by step for better understanding.

Problem Explanation:
You are given three strings s1, s2, and s3.

You need to determine if s3 is formed by interleaving the characters of s1 and s2 while maintaining the relative order of characters from both s1 and s2.

Key Insight:
An interleaving means that the characters from both strings s1 and s2 appear in s3 in such a way that the order of characters within s1 and s2 is preserved.

The key observation is that the length of s3 must be the sum of the lengths of s1 and s2 (i.e., len(s3) = len(s1) + len(s2)).

Dynamic Programming Approach:
We can use a 2D DP table to solve this problem:

Let dp[i][j] represent whether the first i characters of s1 and the first j characters of s2 can form the first i + j characters of s3.

If dp[i][j] is true, it means that s3[0..i+j-1] can be formed by interleaving the first i characters of s1 and the first j characters of s2.

Steps:
Initialize a DP Table:

dp[0][0] = true because an empty s1 and s2 can form an empty s3.

Fill the DP Table:

For each i and j, we check:

If the current character of s1 matches the character in s3 at position i + j - 1, we check the value of dp[i-1][j] (i.e., check if we can form the first i + j - 1 characters using the first i-1 characters of s1 and the first j characters of s2).

Similarly, we check if the current character of s2 matches the character in s3, and if so, check the value of dp[i][j-1].

Final Answer:

The value of dp[len(s1)][len(s2)] will tell us whether s3 can be formed by interleaving s1 and s2.

Edge Case:
If len(s3) != len(s1) + len(s2), return false immediately because it's impossible for s3 to be the interleaving of s1 and s2.

Code Implementation:
java
Copy
public class Solution {
    public boolean isInterleave(String s1, String s2, String s3) {
        // If the lengths don't match, it's impossible to form s3
        if (s1.length() + s2.length() != s3.length()) {
            return false;
        }

        int m = s1.length();
        int n = s2.length();

        // Create a DP table to store the results of subproblems
        boolean[][] dp = new boolean[m + 1][n + 1];

        // Initialize dp[0][0] as true because two empty strings can form an empty string
        dp[0][0] = true;

        // Fill the DP table
        for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
                // If we are not at the first row and the current character of s1 matches the corresponding character in s3
                if (i > 0 && s1.charAt(i - 1) == s3.charAt(i + j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] || dp[i - 1][j];
                }
                // If we are not at the first column and the current character of s2 matches the corresponding character in s3
                if (j > 0 && s2.charAt(j - 1) == s3.charAt(i + j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] || dp[i][j - 1];
                }
            }
        }

        // The answer is in dp[m][n], where m and n are the lengths of s1 and s2 respectively
        return dp[m][n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        String s1 = "abc";
        String s2 = "def";
        String s3 = "adbcef";

        System.out.println(solution.isInterleave(s1, s2, s3)); // Output: true
    }
}
Explanation of Code:
Edge Case Check: First, we check if the lengths of s1, s2, and s3 satisfy the condition len(s1) + len(s2) == len(s3). If not, we immediately return false.

DP Table Initialization:

We create a 2D dp table where dp[i][j] is true if the first i characters of s1 and the first j characters of s2 can form the first i + j characters of s3.

Filling the DP Table:

We iterate over the DP table and fill it based on two conditions:

If we can take a character from s1 to match the corresponding character in s3.

If we can take a character from s2 to match the corresponding character in s3.

Final Answer: The value at dp[m][n] gives the final result. If it is true, then s3 is a valid interleaving of s1 and s2, otherwise false.

Time Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of s1 and s2 respectively. This is because we fill a DP table of size (m + 1) * (n + 1).

Space Complexity: O(m * n) for the DP table.

Example Walkthrough:
Input:
java
Copy
s1 = "abc", s2 = "def", s3 = "adbcef"
At dp[1][1], we can form "a" from s1 and s2.

At dp[1][2], we can form "ad" from s1 and s2.

Continue filling the table using similar logic for all combinations of s1 and s2.

The final value of dp[3][3] will be true, indicating that "adbcef" is an interleaving of "abc" and "def".

Conclusion:
By breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems and using dynamic programming, we can efficiently solve the interleaving string problem with a time complexity of O(m * n).

explain for the beginner human brain

ChatGPT said:
Sure! Let's simplify this problem to make it easier to understand.

Problem:
We are given three strings: s1, s2, and s3. We need to check if s3 can be formed by interleaving the characters of s1 and s2. Interleaving means that we take characters from s1 and s2, and merge them in a way that keeps the order of characters from s1 and s2 intact.

Example:
For example, if:

s1 = "abc"

s2 = "def"

s3 = "adbcef"

We want to know if s3 can be made by taking characters from s1 and s2 and combining them, but keeping the order intact.

In this case, the answer is true because:

From s1 = "abc", we can take "a", then from s2 = "def", we take "d", then from s1 = "abc", we take "b", then from s2 = "def", we take "e", and so on, until we form "adbcef".

Key Insight:
Interleaving means we keep the order of characters from both strings s1 and s2 intact while forming s3.

So we need to check each character of s1 and s2 and decide if they can form s3.

Step-by-Step Process:
We can think of this problem as a matching game:

We try to "match" characters of s3 using the characters of s1 and s2 one by one, keeping the order.

To make this easier to track, we can use a table called a Dynamic Programming (DP) table. This table helps us remember the results of previous steps to avoid doing the same work again and again.

Dynamic Programming Table:
We create a table where:

Each cell dp[i][j] will tell us if we can form the first i characters of s1 and the first j characters of s2 to make the first i + j characters of s3.

Start with an empty solution:

If both s1 and s2 are empty, then s3 must also be empty. This is the base case, so we start by saying dp[0][0] = true (empty s1 + empty s2 = empty s3).

Check if we can extend the solution:

For each position in the table, we look at two possibilities:

Take a character from s1: If the character from s1 matches the current character of s3, then check if the previous characters of s1 and s2 could form the earlier characters of s3.

Take a character from s2: If the character from s2 matches the current character of s3, then check if the previous characters of s1 and s2 could form the earlier characters of s3.

Final result:

After filling the table, the value of dp[len(s1)][len(s2)] will tell us whether we can form the entire s3 using the characters from s1 and s2.

Example Walkthrough:
Let's walk through an example where:

s1 = "abc"

s2 = "def"

s3 = "adbcef"

We create a table (dp) of size (4 x 4) because s1 has 3 characters, s2 has 3 characters, and s3 has 6 characters (the sum of the lengths of s1 and s2).

Initialize DP table:
We initialize the table with false values and set dp[0][0] = true because two empty strings can form an empty string.

Fill the table:
At each cell (i, j), check if we can match characters from s1[i-1] or s2[j-1] with s3[i + j - 1].

Continue filling the table based on these matches.

After filling the table, the value at dp[3][3] will be true, meaning we can form "adbcef" by interleaving "abc" and "def".

Code:
Here’s how we can implement this idea:

java
Copy
public class Solution {
    public boolean isInterleave(String s1, String s2, String s3) {
        // If lengths don't match, return false
        if (s1.length() + s2.length() != s3.length()) {
            return false;
        }

        // DP table to store results
        boolean[][] dp = new boolean[s1.length() + 1][s2.length() + 1];

        // Initialize dp[0][0] as true (empty s1 + empty s2 = empty s3)
        dp[0][0] = true;

        // Fill the DP table
        for (int i = 0; i <= s1.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= s2.length(); j++) {
                // Check if we can take a character from s1
                if (i > 0 && s1.charAt(i - 1) == s3.charAt(i + j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] || dp[i - 1][j];
                }
                // Check if we can take a character from s2
                if (j > 0 && s2.charAt(j - 1) == s3.charAt(i + j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] || dp[i][j - 1];
                }
            }
        }

        // Return the final result from dp
        return dp[s1.length()][s2.length()];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        // Test case
        String s1 = "abc";
        String s2 = "def";
        String s3 = "adbcef";

        // Output: true
        System.out.println(solution.isInterleave(s1, s2, s3));
    }
}
Explanation of the Code:
Edge Case: If the lengths of s1 and s2 don’t add up to the length of s3, return false.

DP Table Initialization: We start by setting dp[0][0] = true, because an empty s1 and s2 can form an empty s3.

Filling the Table: We check if the current character from s1 or s2 matches the corresponding character in s3. If it does, we update the dp table based on the previous results.

Final Result: After filling the table, the value at dp[s1.length()][s2.length()] gives the final answer.

Key Takeaways:
We use dynamic programming (DP) to break the problem into smaller subproblems.

The DP table keeps track of which prefixes of s1 and s2 can form a prefix of s3.

The result at the end of the table (dp[len(s1)][len(s2)]) tells us if s3 is an interleaving of s1 and s2.

This approach helps in efficiently solving the problem without checking all possible combinations of interleavings, which would be inefficient.

why i + j - 1

ChatGPT said:
Great question! The i + j - 1 is used to map the current cell in the dynamic programming (DP) table to the corresponding character in the s3 string.

Let's break it down:
We are given two strings, s1 and s2, and we need to check if their interleaving can form the string s3.

i represents the position of the current character in s1.

j represents the position of the current character in s2.

i + j - 1 represents the position in s3 that we are trying to match.

Why i + j - 1?
When we are processing the (i, j) cell in the DP table, we are trying to see if we can match the characters from s1 and s2 to form the corresponding character in s3.

i + j is the combined length of the substring of s1 and s2 we have processed so far.

But since we are working with zero-based indexing (i.e., indices start from 0), we need to subtract 1 to map the indices correctly.

Visualizing the mapping:
Let’s consider an example:

Suppose s1 = "abc", s2 = "def", and s3 = "adbcef".

The goal is to check if s3 can be formed by interleaving s1 and s2 while maintaining the order of characters in both strings.

At any point in the DP table, we're trying to see if we can take a character from s1[i-1] or s2[j-1] and match it to s3[i+j-1].

Example Walkthrough:
Let’s walk through some values for i and j to see the role of i + j - 1.

When i = 1 and j = 1:

We're checking if we can form the first i + j = 1 + 1 = 2 characters of s3 (i.e., "ad").

The position we are checking in s3 is s3[1 + 1 - 1] = s3[1] = "d".

Now, we compare the characters:

s1[0] = "a" and s2[0] = "d".

So we can take "d" from s2, which matches the character at s3[1].

When i = 2 and j = 1:

Now, we're checking if we can form the first i + j = 2 + 1 = 3 characters of s3 (i.e., "adb").

The position we are checking in s3 is s3[2 + 1 - 1] = s3[2] = "b".

Now, we compare the characters:

s1[1] = "b" and s2[0] = "d".

So we can take "b" from s1, which matches the character at s3[2].

When i = 3 and j = 2:

Now, we're checking if we can form the first i + j = 3 + 2 = 5 characters of s3 (i.e., "adbce").

The position we are checking in s3 is s3[3 + 2 - 1] = s3[4] = "e".

We compare:

s1[2] = "c" and s2[1] = "e".

We take "e" from s2, which matches the character at s3[4].

This process continues until we check all the characters of s1 and s2 and match them against s3.

Summary:
i + j - 1 maps the current position (i, j) in the DP table to the correct position in s3 that we are trying to match.

Since i and j are zero-based, we subtract 1 to adjust for the indexing.

This ensures that we're always checking the correct character of s3 as we build the string by interleaving s1 and s2.


You said:
boolean[][] dp = new boolean[s1.length() + 1][s2.length() + 1]; ? and not boolean[][] dp = new boolean[s1.length()][s2.length()];

ChatGPT said:
Great question! The difference between boolean[][] dp = new boolean[s1.length() + 1][s2.length() + 1]; and boolean[][] dp = new boolean[s1.length()][s2.length()]; is crucial in solving the interleaving string problem, and it's all about accommodating the base cases and properly indexing the DP table.

Let me explain it step by step:

Why +1 is required:
We need to account for the base case where we have not yet processed any characters from s1 or s2.

Base Case: Before we start checking any characters, we must handle the case when both strings are empty. This is important because the dynamic programming table is used to track whether a substring of s1 and a substring of s2 can form the corresponding substring of s3.

Extra Row and Column: By adding 1 to the lengths of s1 and s2, we create an extra row and column in the DP table. These additional positions help handle cases where we are working with no characters from one of the strings.

For example, consider the following:

s1 = "abc"

s2 = "def"

s3 = "adbcef"

DP Table without the extra +1:
If we only use boolean[][] dp = new boolean[s1.length()][s2.length()];, our table will have dimensions of 3x3 (for s1.length() = 3 and s2.length() = 3). But this won't be enough to handle the case where we have to check the first character from either s1 or s2 against the empty string.

For instance, to check if the empty string "" can be interleaved with s2 = "def" to form the first 3 characters of s3 = "adb", we need a row to represent the empty prefix of s1. Similarly, for checking against the empty string s1 = "", we need a column to represent the empty prefix of s2.

How extra row and column help:
By initializing the DP table with an extra row and column, we account for all the possible combinations of prefixes of s1 and s2. Here's how the extra row and column come into play:

First row and column (dp[0][0]): This corresponds to the base case where both s1 and s2 are empty. This should be true because an empty s1 and an empty s2 can interleave to form an empty s3.

First row: Represents cases where we are checking if substrings of s2 can form a part of s3, when s1 is empty.

First column: Represents cases where we are checking if substrings of s1 can form a part of s3, when s2 is empty.

Visualizing the DP Table:
Let’s take s1 = "abc", s2 = "def", and s3 = "adbcef". We need a DP table to check whether the interleaving of s1 and s2 can form s3.

DP Table structure (with an extra row and column):

""	d	e	f
""	T	F	F	F
a	F	T	F	F
ab	F	F	T	F
abc	F	F	F	T
dp[i][j] indicates whether s1[0..i-1] and s2[0..j-1] can interleave to form the first i+j-1 characters of s3.

The dp[0][0] is true because both s1 and s2 are empty, so they trivially form the empty string s3.

The first row (dp[0][j]) corresponds to the case when only s2 contributes to forming s3.

The first column (dp[i][0]) corresponds to the case when only s1 contributes to forming s3.

Now, the recursive relations fill the table based on whether the current characters in s1 or s2 match the current character in s3.

Example Walkthrough:
For example, let's check the first few steps of the DP table:

At dp[1][1], we are comparing s1[0] = "a" and s2[0] = "d" against s3[0] = "a". Since s1[0] matches s3[0], we set dp[1][1] = true.

Similarly, at dp[2][1], we check if s1[1] = "b" can match s3[1] = "d" or if s2[0] = "d" matches s3[1]. This process continues until the table is filled.

Conclusion:
By adding the +1 in the row and column sizes, we ensure that the base case and the necessary checks for empty strings are included in the DP table. This makes the algorithm work correctly for all cases where one string is empty or both strings contribute to forming s3. Without the extra row and column, we would not be able to correctly handle these cases, and the DP table would be too small.
