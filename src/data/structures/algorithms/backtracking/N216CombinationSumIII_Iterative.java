/*
Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:

Only numbers 1 through 9 are used.
Each number is used at most once.
Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

Example 1:
Input: k = 3, n = 7
Output: [[1,2,4]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
There are no other valid combinations.

Example 2:
Input: k = 3, n = 9
Output: [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 6 = 9
1 + 3 + 5 = 9
2 + 3 + 4 = 9
There are no other valid combinations.

Example 3:
Input: k = 4, n = 1
Output: []
Explanation: There are no valid combinations.
Using 4 different numbers in the range [1,9], the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 > 1, there are no valid combination.

Constraints:

2 <= k <= 9
1 <= n <= 60

Great question! Yes ‚Äî **math can help us reason and optimize** the problem, but it **cannot fully solve it alone**, because this is a **combinatorics + search** problem. Let‚Äôs break it down.

## ‚úÖ Where Math Helps

### 1. **Early Elimination Using Bounds**
You can use math to **quickly reject impossible cases**.

#### ‚úÖ Smallest possible sum:
If you want to pick `k` **smallest numbers** from 1‚Äì9, the smallest sum is:
```
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k*(k + 1)/2
```

#### ‚úÖ Largest possible sum:
If you want to pick the `k` **largest numbers**, the largest sum is:
```
9 + 8 + 7 + ... + (10 - k) = k*(19 - k)/2
```

### üîç So before even starting, check:
```java
if (n < k*(k + 1)/2 || n > k*(19 - k)/2) return [];  // no possible combinations
```

This avoids wasting time when it's mathematically impossible.

---

### 2. **Counting the number of possible combinations (optional)**

If you want to **just count** how many combinations are possible, you could use combinatorics:

- Pick `k` numbers out of 9 ‚Üí use `C(9, k)` (binomial coefficient)
- Then **filter** only those whose sum is `n`

But generating those combinations still requires checking each one.

---

## ‚ùå Where Math Alone Can‚Äôt Help

Math can‚Äôt directly give you all the valid combinations. Why?

Because you need to **generate specific groups of numbers** that:
- Are **distinct**
- Come from the set `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`
- Add up to exactly `n`

This is a **subset sum** problem with constraints, and it needs **search (backtracking)** to build combinations one-by-one.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Step                        | Can Math Help? |
|-----------------------------|----------------|
| Early pruning               | ‚úÖ Yes (min/max sum) |
| Count possible combinations | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially |
| Generate exact combinations | ‚ùå Needs backtracking |
